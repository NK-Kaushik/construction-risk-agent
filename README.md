# AI Construction Project Delay & Cost Overrun Risk Agent

## Overview
Construction projects frequently miss deadlines and exceed budgets despite having large amounts of operational data. This project demonstrates an AI-powered decision support system that proactively identifies schedule delay and cost overrun risks and explains the underlying causes.

## Key Capabilities
- Machine learning model to predict delay and cost overrun risk
- AI agent that reasons over project signals and risk outputs
- LLM-based explanation of risk drivers and mitigation strategies
- REST API for integration with project management dashboards

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- FastAPI
- Large Language Models (LLM)
- Rule-based AI Agent Logic

## Use Case
Designed for construction project managers to support proactive decision-making rather than reactive reporting.
